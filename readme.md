Description:

This project is about an E-commerce shop for interior design products.
There are 3 kinds of users, which you can divide into two main users:

1. Admin- has the authorizations of managing a store and users.
   The admin can add, update and delete products in the shop.
   In addition, the admin can choose which products to display.
2. Users- there are two kinds of users: regular users and premium users.
   the admin can change a regular user into a premium user and vice versa.
   The difference between a premium and a regular user is that a premium user received 15% off on all products in the shop.

Moreover, I implemented a report system, where the user can leave a report to the admin and the admin responds back.
